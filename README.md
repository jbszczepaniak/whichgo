## whichgo
Tries to answer question: what version of go is your source code using, based on definition for go modules.

Works with git repositories, modules that are cached in the GOPROXY, and directories on local machine. 
## Example
```shell script
whichgo https://github.com/jbszczepaniak/whichgo
go 1.13
```
